## üåü Introduction

The **CBC_A-014 NDVI Prediction System** is an intelligent web application designed to predict vegetation health and density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This project leverages deep learning models to provide accurate NDVI predictions for different geographical zones (North, South, East, and West), making it a valuable tool for environmental monitoring, agriculture, and land management.

---

## üéØ Project Purpose

NDVI is a crucial metric in remote sensing and environmental science, helping researchers and practitioners:

- **Monitor Vegetation Health**: Track the vitality and density of vegetation over time
- **Agricultural Planning**: Support precision agriculture and crop management decisions
- **Environmental Assessment**: Evaluate ecosystem changes and land use patterns
- **Climate Research**: Understand the impact of climate variations on vegetation

This system democratizes access to NDVI predictions by providing an intuitive web interface backed by machine learning models trained for regional accuracy.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.7 or higher
python --version

# pip package manager
pip --version
```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sachethanv/CBC_A-014.git
cd CBC_A-014
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow numpy
```

### Step 4: Verify Model Files

Ensure the following model files are present in the project directory:
- `NDVI predictor model east.h5`
- `NDVI predictor model north.h5`
- `NDVI predictor model south.h5`
- `NDVI predictor model west.h5`

---

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask server:**

```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Access the web interface:**

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

3. **Make Predictions:**
   - Select your geographical region (North, South, East, or West)
   - Input the required parameters
   - Click "Predict" to receive NDVI values
   - View and analyze the results

### API Endpoints

The application exposes RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access:

```bash
# Example prediction request
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "region": "north",
  "parameters": [...]
}
```

---

## üß† Model Architecture

The system uses four independently trained neural network models:

- **North Model**: Optimized for northern geographical patterns
- **South Model**: Tailored for southern vegetation characteristics
- **East Model**: Specialized for eastern regional data
- **West Model**: Configured for western zone predictions

Each model has been trained on region-specific datasets to ensure maximum accuracy and reliability.
